# Plessi
[WIP] [Multi-Tool] Plessi, the Dino that can do many useful things!

## Todo
Make & Upload more code

Fix exit button on nsp installer

## Download
When I think a build is ready, I will release it [here](https://github.com/CVFireDragon/Plessi/releases/latest)

## Building

**I don't recommend building unless you know what you are doing.

Download devKitPro if you don't have it (install switch support)

Then, open CMD in the folder with ```Makefile``` and type ```make```

## Credits
