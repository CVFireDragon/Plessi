# Plessi
# This Project is dead
[WIP] Plessi, the Nintendo Switch MultiTool!

## Todo
Write & Upload more code

## Download
When I think a build is ready, I will release it [here](https://github.com/CVFireDragon/Plessi/releases/latest)

## Building

**I don't recommend building unless you know what you are doing.**

Download devKitPro if you don't have it (install switch support)

Then, open CMD in the folder with ```Makefile``` and type ```make```

## Credits
